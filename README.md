# Getting Started with Metamart

This guide walks you through setting up and running the project, providing helpful resources for development, learning, and deployment. The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), making it easy to dive into Next.js.

## **Getting Started Locally**

### **Step 1: Run the Development Server**

To start your development server, use one of the following commands based on your package manager:

```bash
npm run dev       # If using npm
yarn dev          # If using Yarn
pnpm dev          # If using pnpm
bun dev           # If using Bun
```
Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view your application.

The application will automatically reload as you make changes to the source files, allowing for a smooth and efficient development experience.

### **Step 2: Modify the Main Page**

The main entry point for your application is located in the `app/page.js` file. Begin by editing this file to customize the default page.

The changes you make will reflect in real-time in your browser without requiring you to restart the server.

### **Step 3: Explore Fonts and Styles**

This project uses the [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) feature, which allows you to optimize and load custom fonts, such as Googleâ€™s Inter font. This ensures improved performance and better typography out of the box.
